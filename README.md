# Marlin 3D Printer Firmware
Fork of Marlin  2.0.X Bugfix from March 12th, 2022, for a CR10 V1 (2017) with SKR Mini E3 V3, with a BL Touch.
Notes: Extruder Assembly swapped with Dual Gear Metal Extruder assembly, so you will need to adjust extruder esteps from the menu and the extruder offsets for the BL Touch.
Still uses the Z Axis end stop.
